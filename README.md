## Foldit model of BglB for the Bagel project

This repository contains a macromolecular model of BglB that is used for design efforts in the Siegel group's Bagel project. Four files are included:

+ `pNPG.params`, Rosetta params file
+ `pNPG.conf.pdb`, three different low-energy conformers of the pNPG molecule
+ `pNPG.enzdes.cst`, RosettaMatch-style constraints (deprecated)
+ `pNPG.cnstr`, harmonic Rosetta constraints (preferred!)
+ `bglb.pdb`, relaxed model of BglB-pNPG complex
