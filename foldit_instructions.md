# Instructions for designing mutations to BglB using the protein editor Foldit Standalone

This repository contains a macromolecular model of BglB based on the crystal structure 2JIE that is used for design efforts in the Siegel group's Bagel project. Read on to learn how to use Foldit for enzyme design.

## Loading and saving structures

To load your protein:

"Load FASTA/PDB" > opens a file selection window

You must select the BglB PDB file (bglb.pdb), along with the two params files for the pNPG molecule (pNPG.params and pNPG.conf.pdb), and the chemical restraits that tell Foldit to keep the pNPG in a catalytically-relevant conformation.

To save a PDB file: `Ctrl-Alt-Shift-S`

Many Foldit shortcuts are prefixed with `Ctrl-Alt-Shift`.

## Recommended view options

+ "Cartoon Thin"
+ "Score/Hydro+CPK"
+ show/hide bonds/voids as needed for context

## Inspect individual residue energies

Mouse over residue so it is highlighted and hit Tab.

This info panel gives a breakdown of the various score terms for the selected residue. Importance of score is in order as it appears in the menu

## Viewing operations

+ Zoom to Area of Interest: Mouse over residue of interest so it is highlighted;  hit Shift-Q  (no click) I often move around until I see the ligand and then do this

+ BackShading:  Ctrl-Shift-Click (on black backdrop) and drag

+ Front Clipping:  Ctrl-Alt-Click (on black backdrop) and drag

+ Measuring:  Mouse over atom1 of interest, hit Ctrl-Alt-Shift-C (no click), repeat for atom 2 (reports distance), atom 3 (angle), and atom 4 (dihedral)

## Selection operations

+ Select a sphere of residues around a residue that you are hovering over: `Ctrl-Shift-click` on residue and drag outwards

+ See upper left corner of Foldit for number of residues selected

## Using the Lua terminal  

+ Main --> Script Terminal
+ Select specific residue:  selection.Select(<res#>)
+ Zoom to specific residue:  ui.CenterViewport(<res#>)

## How to design mutants in Foldit

+ Click residue and hit mutate (m) to see options for new residues
+ Selecting a subset of residues (lower right boxes) can be used to do directed designs
+ Selection will be used in both mutate AND shake (i.e. shake now mutates those residues while everything else stays native).
+ **Never** wiggle (w) without selecting a sub-selection!
+ Sometimes high energies (mutations/conformations) are need to get to the low energy
+ Native amino acid or close to native amino acid is generally better
+ Manually force the interaction you want and then side-chain wiggle (E) those residues and the ones around it
+ General order of operations:  E --> S --> E
+ If score is not dropping faster than 0.05/s you are likely at an energy minimum. This is true **only for** wiggling (w/e).  If you are shaking (s) pay attention to the number of cycles on the upper left corner.  Often the low energy is found after 5-10 cycles (cycles is the number in the parenthesis after the timer).

## How to choose mutants

For an individual residue:

+ Total energy less than 0 is good
+ Total energy between 0 and +2 can be OK if clash score (fa_rep) is <1
+ Total energy between +2 and +5 are iffy, but can work if you think the Rosetta picture of the protein is missing an enabling feature
+ Total energy between +5 and +10 are are unlikely. Something will likely have to move for this to work, thus the protein is unlikely to look like your model
+ Energies >+10 are are really unlikely to workâ€¦ but go for it if you have a good reason

Don't worry about the total protein score too much, as long as it is less than native, or not more than 5 Rosetta Energy Units higher than native.

Focus on the molecular interactions in the neighborhood of the residue you are mutating
